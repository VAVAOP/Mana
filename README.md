# Mana
new cryptocurrency concept token
in this project iam going to build an simple model of token contract with the help of solidity
and which is run on EVM(Etherium Virtual Machine)
so this new token name is mana
and it has some basic features like
necessary variables,
mapping address,
mint function,
burn function etc.
the simple explanation of working of this token is that the sender with specefic adress can mint token to their account and can check the balance and also the sender can burn tokens too which also reflect in balance but sender can't burn tokens more than his total supply
